# Tideline: tests

Every test below comes from docs/SRS.md. IDs match the SRS exactly. Rows marked "proposed" are not in the SRS; they fill a gap and need the human's OK.

How tests are run:

- unit and cli tests: the project's test runner (Node), run from the repo root.
- e2e tests: Claude in Chrome against the Vercel Preview, at 1440px and again at 375px.
- contract tests: near-sdk-rs tests for the attest contract (INV-1 to INV-3 included).
- manual: a person checks by hand and records what they saw.

Result starts as "⏭ not run". Evidence (screenshot, log, command output) is added when a test is run.

Tests written for the Explorer API or a quote archive (T-1.1, T-2.1, T-3.x quote traces, T-5.6, T-7.3, T-7.4, T-21.1) were replaced by chain-day tests in T1 to T6 (docs/PLAN.md §4).

## Preview states (proposed)

These are not in the SRS. They check the states the screens should show when data is old, loading, failed, anchored or mismatched (SRS 9.4, NFR-6). Expected text comes from the Figma frames and needs the human's confirmation.

| ID | Covers | Type | Steps (short) | Expected | Result | Evidence |

## Non-functional checks (proposed)

The SRS lists NFR-3 and NFR-4 but gives them no test ID.

| ID | Covers | Type | Steps (short) | Expected | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N-1 (proposed) | NFR-3 | manual | Load golden-path pages on throttled 4G; view at 375px | Load under 2s; no horizontal scroll | ⏭ not run | |
| N-2 (proposed) | NFR-4 | manual | Check text colour pairs on every screen | Contrast at least 4.5:1 | ⏭ not run | |
| N-3 (proposed) | NFR-7 | cli | Scan the repo for secrets; confirm `.env` is gitignored | None found | ⏭ not run | |

## Visual checks

Dropped 3 Nov 2026: the human stopped using Figma, and the site now follows DESIGN-REFERENCE-3.md (rule 21), not the Figma frames. The pages were checked in Chrome instead (see T-6.3, P-1 to P-7, N-2), and the human reviews the look at G6.

- [ ] S1 against its frame at 1440 and 375
- [ ] S2 against its frame at 1440 and 375
- [ ] S3 against its frame at 1440 and 375
